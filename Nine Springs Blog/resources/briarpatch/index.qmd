In Dane County it is estimated approximately 300 youth go to bed homeless each night. 1 in 3 youth will be approached for sex in exchange for food, shelter, drugs, etc. within 48 hours of leaving home; 75% of these youth have already or will drop out of school. These are good kids in bad situations and they need our help. The staff at Briarpatch Youth Services work with these youth to make sure they have the resources and support they need in order to succeed.
