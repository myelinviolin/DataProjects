We are a 501(c)3 non-profit organization based in Madison, Wisconsin and serving the Midwest region. Our mission is to support and connect farmers and eaters through Community Supported Agriculture (CSA). We envision a future where CSA is the backbone of a strong local food system and where all families have access to locally-produced, organic food from small-scale farms.
