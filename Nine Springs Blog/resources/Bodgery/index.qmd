We\'re open to the public every Monday and Friday night. We offer a variety of classes and host many no-cost community programs.

We have (literally) tons of tools spread across all kinds of making and plenty of space to use them.

Whether learning a tool, honing a craft, building a business, or finding a creative group of makers, this is your place to build skills and community!

Guests are always welcome at the Bodgery. But there are benefits to becoming a member! Members have 24/7 access to all of our tools, storage space, member-only classes and communication channels, and a vote in community decisions.
