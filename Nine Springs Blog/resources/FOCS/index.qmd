The Friends work to connect the entire community with the wonders of nature found at Capital Springs Recreation Area, including miles of undisturbed lakeshore, large stretches of oak savanna and prairie, meandering Nine Springs Creek, mixed oak woodlands and many, many acres of wetlands.

This 2,500-acre, urban-edge park is centrally located in Dane County, extending from Fish Hatchery Road to the western shore of Lake Waubesa.
